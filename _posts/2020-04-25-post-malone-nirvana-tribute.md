## Stay Home To Stay Safe
Post Malone recently performed a Nirvana tribute show.  Livestreamed on April 24, 2020 at 6PM EST from his house.  It was to raise awareness for COV-19.  

> `100%!` of the proceeds went directly to the World Health Organization.

It was a great set and he did an awesome job.  Took me back to being in school.  For all the shit he gets, I think he's a talented musician.

Check out the show and make sure to [donate](https://unfoundation.org/).
