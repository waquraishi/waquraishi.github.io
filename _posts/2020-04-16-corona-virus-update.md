The world seems to be going crazy.  I can't recall a time where things could be stranger.  It seems like 
all of the post-apocalyptic movies and stories we read are all coming true.  Although it's only been a short few weeks, the world outside my window is far different than I recall.

## Deaths in Virginia
As of this morning, our state is 18th in the nation in terms of overall infections at 6,182. The top infected county which shouldn't come as a surprise is Fairfax.  It's in northern Virgina so closer proximity to New York as well as it being a densely, populated urban area.

## My Thoughts
Not sure how I feel about this.  One part feels we have to protect others around us and be good global citizens.  On the other hand, individuals need to take personal responsibility. We can't operate using the 
lowest common denominator.  What I mean by that is society shouldn't be locked down for everyone.  Those that are comprised - the old, unhealty and overweight should protect themselves by staying in.  For the others, we should be allowed to resume our activities at a controlled pace.
