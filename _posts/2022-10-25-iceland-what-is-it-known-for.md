# Iceland: What It's Known For ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¸ 
- - -
Iceland is known for its stunning waterfalls, and there are several worth exploring. Here are a few notable ones:

1. **Gullfoss:** Part of the Golden Circle, Gullfoss is a powerful two-tiered waterfall on the HvÃ­tÃ¡ River.
2. **Seljalandsfoss:** Along the South Coast, this waterfall is unique because you can walk behind it for a different perspective.
3. **Skogafoss:** Also on the South Coast, Skogafoss is an impressive, thundering waterfall with a staircase leading to the top for panoramic views.
4. **Godafoss:** Known as the "Waterfall of the Gods," it's located in northern Iceland and is particularly scenic.
5. **Hraunfossar:** These waterfalls are unique as they flow out of a lava field, creating a series of rivulets.
6. **Dettifoss:** In the northeast, it's one of Europe's most powerful waterfalls, located in VatnajÃ¶kull National Park.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more scattered throughout the country. Each has its own charm and character, offering a great opportunity to experience Iceland's natural beauty.
